# DOGGSTER

Welcome to Doggster! We are excited to be guiding you and your best friend in forming a special bond nurtured with love and respect. Every pooch is a part of our evergrowing family, and we always give 100% commitment to their training and exercise. Our primary focus is to understand your dog before we start with any training, and we believe every dog can 
learn to behave in the right way and listen to their owners.


## UX

The perfect client for this business is a person who owns a dog, and it's looking for the training services. The age & size of the dog is not essential, which allows a broader scope of potential clients. Copy on the website is friendly focused, which could indicate to 
clients that their dog will have fun and be in a lovely environment while training.

#### Project Goals 

- For new clients the goal is to contact us to find out more about available trainings and about us as a business

- For exsisting clients the goal is to make booking the training sessions as seemless as possible.
